# Velo UI

Velo UI is yet another design system built with React. It provides ready-to-use components that you can easily use in your web application.

This project aims to achieve these three major objectives:

- Should provide most of the common components for building a web service.
- Should be able to support dark theme without any hassle.
- Should be easily customizable.
